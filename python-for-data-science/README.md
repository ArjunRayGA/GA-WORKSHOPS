## About This Workshop

Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language with many applications. This workshop explores Python's place in the scientific ecosystem, and how the language, with several readily-available open-source libraries, can serve as a powerful tool for data analysis. Designed as a stand-alone introduction to the data science aspects of Python, this class is also a recommended preparatory workshop for students planning to enroll in General Assembly's Data Science course. We will also be covering topics from probability, statistics, regression and classification.

By the end of the workshop, students will be able to:
* Use pandas to perform data analysis
* Use matplotlib to make visualizations of the data
* Sci-kit learn to generate a statistical model of the data
* Have a working understanding of the statistical models being used
